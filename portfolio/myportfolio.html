                <p>
                    Making this website was for me very fun and different from usual, like getting some fresh air.
                    That because I made this portfolio as a homework for the university, but what make it different is the way I created it.
                </p><p>
                    The university asked to make a portfolio website, but using other sites like WordPress or Wix.
                    What made this site different is that I decided to write it myself in HTML instead of using premade website using other sites.
                </p><p>
                    I decided to program my portfolio out of nowhere, I can almost say I was just inspired to do so.
                    But that is not the only reason behind my choice.
                    What made my change my mind and start programming this website was the limited possibility of customizing my website the way I wanted.
                </p><p>
                    I haven't programmed in HTML since highschool so at first I had to regain my full knowledge, and that made my work harder but also more enjoyable.
                </p>

            <div class="my-work">
                <h2>Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to program this website while I was working on the <a href="/portfolio/myshoppinglist.html"><b>Shopping List</b></a> all day.
                    So changing was like a blessing for me, as it allowed me to distract my mind and take a break from the other project.
                </p><p>
                    In order to create my portfolio I did a lot of research, looking for others portfolio on internet and taking notes.
                    I looked at many different portfolio, from the ones that summarize everything in one page to the ones that looked like corporate website.
                </p><p>
                    After that I decided to use an in-between style that shows everything on the main page but have connections to other pages that explains in details my works.
                    I also took inspiration from said portoflios to create my own layout and colour palette to make my portfolio look professional and elegant.
                    So I choose colours and disposition following <b>design theory</b> and thanks to a friend that works in this sector I was able to implement it correctly.

                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to this project I learned the importance of design theories and UI/UX in websites.
                    That is something I think I would never learned if I worked using software like ProdPress, where they automatically apply those knowledge.
                </p><p>
                    Now I've learned more about the role users play and how their experience improves as the interface improves.
                    Having a user who can navigate intuitively can bring many more benefits than one who doesn't understand what they need to do.
                    And that is done thanks to how the interface looks and perform to help users navigate the website, or the user may just close it and never use it.
                </p><p>
                    I also learned that having breaks and do something else can improve my productivity and concentration, other than relax myself for a better health.
